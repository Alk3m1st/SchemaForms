# SchemaForms

This project is for Schema-driven Angular froms to help create highly flexible, config-based forms quickly.

## Motivation

After building many, many, many forms the manual way it became evident that it was a wasteful, repetitive exercise. There needed to be an easier way to create forms quickly and keep them flexible enough to allow quick, non-breaking changes in the future. To be able to support multi-step forms with various types of validation as well as interdependant logic between fields.
